  This paper proposed a improved current steering topology with switched-capacitor phase error compensation technique for variable gain amplifiers. The mechanism of the optimization is validated with  mathematical formulas and simulation results. 
  
  Compared with other optimization techniques on phase error, the proposed switched-capacitor compensation technique has simpler topology with great effectiveness.
