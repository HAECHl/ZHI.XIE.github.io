About Me
======
  I'm a student on the 3rd and last year of the Master program in the [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/index.htm), with joint degree in the [Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.aircas.cas.cn/).In 2021, I received the Bachelor degree in electronic information engineering from [China Agricultural University](https://www.cau.edu.cn/), Beijing, China.
  
  I am very fortunate to be advised by [RUI WU](http://www.aircas.cn/sourcedb_air_cas/cn/expert/yjy/202306/t20230613_6777600.html)  from Chinese Academy of Sciences. Under his guidance, I'm majoring in RF integrated circuit designs and have gained rich experience in the area through out the years. My research interests include RF/mm-wave integrated circuit designs, front-ends in phased-array systems and I'm always eager for new knowledge and to expand a wider range of capability.

  Currently I'm seeking for a PhD postion on RF integrated circuit design or other related fields.

  Please contact with me through [Email](mailto:zhitse@gmail.com)/[Wechat](/wechat.png).
