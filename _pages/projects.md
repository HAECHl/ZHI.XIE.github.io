A 7 bit Ka-Band Passive-Active Hybrid Attenuator on TSMC 65 nm CMOS
======
- Implemented a  Ka-Band  6 bit digital step attenuator using Bridge-T/Pi switch-type attenuator units for their high gain-tuning accuracy and small chip area. Due to the parasitic capacitors of the transistor in high frequency, capacitive compensation technique is applied to  optimize the phase error. The attenuator achieves an attenuation range of 0 $\sim$ 15.75 dB  with a 0.16 dB RMS attenuation error and a maximum 6.01° Phase Error.

- Designed a 1 bit variable gain amplifier for gain tuning and gain compensating. Proposed a improved current steering topology with switched capacitor for variable gain amplifiers which optimizes the phase error. Implemented a  Ka-band  1 bit 16 dB VGA in the proposed topology with a phase error of 1.4°.

- Cascaded a  6 bit attenuator and a 1 bit attenuator to realize a Ka-band 7 bit hybrid attenuator with a minimum insertion loss of 0.52 dB, a low RMS gain error of 0.18 dB and a low RMS phase error

- Managed the whole process of circuit design, chip layout design.
  
 


A  DC-2 Gz Digital Step Attenuator in a mm-Wave Broadband Transceiver on TSMC 65 nm CMOS
======
- Researched into the switch-type attenuator and its operating principle. Acknowledged its advantage of simpler topology and smaller chip area in comparison with switch-path, distributed and other types of attenuators. Systematically trained the skills over layout drawing and gained the first experience of tapeout.
  
- Composed the 6 bit attenuator with Bridge-T/-Pi switch-type attenuator units which achieves an attenuation range of 0 $\sim$ 31.5 dB  with a RMS attenuation error of 0.16 dB.
  
- Designed the layout of the differential attenuator and the supporting transmission lines to the pad.
  
- Collaborated with doctors and professors from Tsinghua University. Improved ability on communicating and collaborating through the teamwork despite under the quarantine during the pandemic.
  

A K-Band Compact mm-Wave Low Noise Amplifier on TSMC 65 nm CMOS  
======
- Mastered basic skills on circuit design and software operating through the project. Learned the structure, the design protocols and other fundamental conceptions of the CMOS technology. Paved the way of further research on CMOS integrated circuits.
  
- Implemented a one-stage cascode LNA with source negative feedback which achieves 15.9 dB gain and NF of 2.5 dB which shows good noise performance. 

- Designed the inductors into the shape of '8' to decouple the inductors in the circuit. Overlapping the decoupled inductors to pare down the chip area by 72\%.
